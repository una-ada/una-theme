# Una's VSCode Theme

_Work in progress!_

## Icons

The file icon theme contains 12x12 .PNG files; this means that, by default, VS
Code will stretch the images to fit its 16x16 area for file icons. To remedy
this, please refer to [this gist][1].

I do intend to eventually update the icons to SVGs, and to handle the scaling
different. However, since this is a highly personalized project, this will have
to do for now! Apologies for any inconvenience.
